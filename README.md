# Advanced-Problem-Solving
Repository for reviewing awesome coding questions


# Math-Driven Algorithms 🚀

This repository is a curated collection of mathematically intensive algorithm problems I’ve solved to strengthen my fundamentals in number theory, combinatorics, and algorithmic reasoning.

It serves as a personal knowledge base and a preparation log for coding interviews, competitive programming, and placement readiness.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

> I created this repository to **go deeper into mathematical reasoning using code** — a critical but often skipped part of interview prep and problem-solving. It also helps me **explain my thinking**, making me a better communicator for interviews.
